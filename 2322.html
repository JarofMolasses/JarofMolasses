                        Attempts to reverse engineer a digital bench power supply and improve its performance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The 2322 is a dual channel, 30V 2A programmable supply. 
                        It is a nice unit overall, and I really do like this sort of multi-channel remote control programmable linear power supply. They're also really expensive most of the time.
                        <br><br>
                        This one came with a few inexcusable issues, in my opinion. 
                        Some of the behaviour was so strange I thought it was faulty, and I felt compelled to 
                        reverse engineer the circuit to see if I could do something about it. 
                        <br><br>
                        <small>Spoiler: I'm pretty sure now that it was just designed that way.</small>
                    </p>

                    <h4> The issues </h4>
                    <h5 id="poweron">Issue 1. Power-on step response</h5>
                    <p>
                        <img src="2322/enable_overshoot_20V.jpg" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        Two distinct problems are shown in this power on/off curve. 
                        <li>The constant current limit kicks on every startup - that's the weird linear slope as the output capacitor charges</li>
                        <li>There is overshoot at CC-CV transition and also when the output is disabled</li>
                        <br>

                        The former problem is not really major, and any power supply with current limiting will do this if the current is set low enough, and the 
                        inrush current \(i_C\) into the output capacitors is enough to trip the current limiter. <br>
                        $$ i_C = C\frac{dV}{dt}$$
                        What's strange about this unit is that the power-on behaviour does not depend on the set current limit. No matter 
                        the set current, the output capacitor will trip the current limit on startup at higher set voltages (as though the real current limit only kicks in after a delay... more on that later).
                        <br><br>
                        The latter problem is pretty serious. That is about 0.3V on the rising edge and -0.7V on the falling edge. I think something like this won't destroy anything.
                        However, it is quite ugly, isn't it? That's not what you want from a precision power supply.
                    </p>

                    <h5 id="multistep">Issue 2. "Multi-step" output</h5>
                    <p>
                        <img src="2322/enable_multistep.jpg" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        When the supply does not switch into CC mode during power-on - i.e. when 
                        it is allowed to turn on "normally" - it looks like it takes several intermediate steps before settling at the programmed setpoint. <br>
                        <small><i>The setpoint in that picture is pretty high, but this was done with some of the output capacitance removed so the inrush current was much lower and the limiter wouldn't trip</i></small>
                    </p>

                    <h5 id="CC">Issue 3. Slow CC response </h5>
                    <p>
                        <img src="2322/CC overshoot.jpg" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        Here's the voltage over a 47 ohm resistor with the output set to 8V and 10mA. The voltage rises to 8V before the current limit kicks in, 
                        in other words a peak 170mA is drawn. It takes around 20ms for the controller to bring the current back down.
                        Though a bench supply is not the best option for a precision low current source (especially not this one, the CC mode noise is 
                        only specified as 1mArms), this ought to be improved a bit. <br>
                    </p>

                    <h4 id="Reverse engineering"> Reverse engineering and modifications </h4>
                    I could not find any schematics for this unit, though I could find a service manual with schematics for an AMREL LPS-305 which has a similar output stage and control loop 
                    and provided a good starting point to try reverse engineering this thing. 
                    <a href="https://elektrotanya.com/sites/default/files/forum/2018/07/lps301_305_service_manual_1803.pdf">This is an *exceptionally bad* service manual, by the way.</a>
                    <p>
                        <img src="2322/2322internal.jpg" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        The main functional components of the unit are the mainboard, the power supply board, and the digital card.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="2322/Front.jpg" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        The interesting parts are here, on the mainboard. The digital card connects to the 8-bit ISA connector (Channel 1 signals) and the IDC connector in the bottom left (Channel 2 signals).
                        The digital card uses an 8051 at its core, or more specifically a 80C31 clone. It might be worthwhile to make a replacement with a modern microcontroller.
                        The communication between the card and each channel is done through photocouplers, and each channel is completely separate on the mainboard. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <img src="2322/reverse.jpg" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        Here I draw all the visible traces (front copper in red, back copper in blue) over a picture of the board to make it a little easier to see the connections at a glance. 
                        For now, I've only reverse engineered Channel 1, though Channel 2 should be more of the same. 

                    <h5 id="DAC">DAC sample and hold</h5>
                    <p>
                        <img src="2322/DAC.png" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        <img src="2322/sampleandhold.png" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        The reference voltages for the controllers are generated by an AD7541 12-bit DAC and 4066 CMOS switch in a sample-and-hold configuration. The signal is held by 2x470nF capacitors with a 1k in series, then buffered. 
                        The DAC is also used to generate voltages for a software SAR ADC used to read back the voltage and current.
                        <br><br>
                        It is here where the power-on CC/CV and multi-step issues occur.

                        A "floating regulator" type output stage. The unregulated input 60VDC has no shared ground with the rest of the circuit. Circuit ground is at the 
                        emitter of the series pass transistors (RMI = GND), while signal ground is at the output positive rail (+OUT = SGND). This circuit is nearly identical to that of the LPS-305 negative rail.

                        Readback is done using a software SAR ADC running on the microcontroller.
                        The DAC output is periodically used to generate reference voltages for the measurement comparators.

                        A typical diode-OR CV/CC control sharing scheme. The top branch is a pure integrator which handles current control. The bottom branch
                        is a filtered PID controller for voltage control.
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="2322/output closeup.png" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        The output sense nodes:
                        <li>The input to shunt resistor \(R_{s}\) is node RMI (high side), and the output is node RMO (low side). </li>
                        <li>The global circuit ground is at RMI, and the signal ground (for the controller setpoint signals) is at RMO. </li>
                        <li>Voltage feedback S+ and S- are normally externally strapped to the +OUT and -OUT output terminals, respectively. RMO is also directly connected to +OUT.</li>
                    </p>

                    <h6><b>Current controller</b></h6>
                    <p>
                        The output current through \(R_{s}\) is sensed by measuring voltage at RMO, where $$-V_{RMO} = I_{out}R_S = I_{out}/10.$$
                        <img src="2322/CC controller.png" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        The current control is done by U33A, which compares current programming signal CCP to RMO. U32B converts CCP from signal ground reference to circuit ground reference, and inverts it.
                        R61 and R69 attenuate CCP by 50, and with a maximum DAC output voltage of 10V, the maximum programmable CCP signal is 200mV and the maximum programmable current is 2A. 
                        Ultimately, the controller setpoint can be expressed as
                        $$V_{Iset} = R_sI_{set} \text{ where } I_{set} = -CCP/5$$
                        The measured error signal is
                        $$e = V_{RMO}-V_{Iset} = R_s(-I_{out}-I_{set})$$

                        U33A is used as a pure integrator with R1 (R68 in the schematic) and C1 (C40). Anti-windup diodes D14, D13, D12 prevent the error accumulation from getting out of hand.
                        The transfer function of the current controller can be written as 
                        $$\frac{V_{i}}{e}(s) = \frac{-1}{sR_1 C_1}, $$

                        and the crossover frequency is given by $$f_{i} = \frac{1}{2\pi R_1 C_1} = 10.61\mathrm{kHz} .$$

                        <br><br>

                        The CC controller isn't very good, and part of the reason it is slow may be because it is missing a proportional action. It's also quite bad at rejecting power supply ripple. 
                        I suppose the reason for using a pure I-controller here is so that it has a very subdued response and the CV loop can dominate. Usually, CV mode is the normal 
                        operating condition for a lab power supply, so it's reasonable that voltage control gets priority over current control. 
                        Still, it may be good to push the CC loop crossover frequency up to try to suppress the current overshoot a bit.
                    </p>

                        The voltage controller at U33B is sort of shaped like a Type-3 compensator, and is in effect a filtered derivative PID controller. 
                        The controller's setpoint is fixed at signal ground, i.e.:
                        $$V_{Vset} = V_{S+}.$$

                        The "actual" setpoint which controls the output voltage is the CVP signal, fed in at a summing junction at the inverting input of U33B. Thus, we have error signal given by
                        $$e=3.57CVP + V_{S-} - V_{V_Vset}$$

                        For this AC analysis of the controller, we can choose arbritrary DC values \(V_{S+}=CVP=0\mathrm{V}\), so that
                        $$e=V_{S-}$$ 

                        U33B has a local feedback network formed by R1 (R84), C1 (C48), R2 (R80), Rd (R81), Cd (C52). R73 does not affect the controller frequency response. 
                        The transfer function for the voltage controller can be written as 
                        $$\frac{V_{v}}{e}(s) = -\frac{R_1}{R_2+R_d}\frac{(\omega_{z1}/s + 1)(s/\omega_{z2} + 1)}{(1 + 1/\omega_{p}s)},$$
                        where the pole and zero frequencies can be found as:
                        $$\omega_{z1} = \frac{1}{C_1R_1} \rightarrow f_{z1} = 7.8\mathrm{kHz},$$
                        $$\omega_{z2} = \frac{1}{C_dR_d} \rightarrow f_{z2} = 445\mathrm{kHz},$$
                        $$\omega_{p} = \frac{1}{C_d (R_2//R_d)} \rightarrow f_{p} = 16\mathrm{kHz}.$$
                        <br>

                        With the output set to 30V and a 10k load, the phase margin is around 74 degrees, and the system crossover frequency is 4.6kHz.

                    <h6><b>Multistep waveforms and sequencing problem</b></h6>
                    <p>
                        <img src="2322/sample and hold demo.jpg" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        Here we see the current programming and voltage programming waveforms at the output of the 4066. The two waveforms above show the CVP_PULSE signal and the CVP_SWITCH signal, 
                        and the other pair are the CCP_PULSE and CCP_SWITCH signals. From this it's clear that the time constant of the RC network in the sample and hold is too long 
                        for the programming pulse duration, and it takes a couple cycles to get to the programmed level, on both rise and fall. This is what causes the "multistep" power-on/off waveform.
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="2322/sample and hold bad spice.png" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        In SPICE, we can confirm this is expected behaviour based on the selected R, C and programming pulse duration. 
                        Unless I'm missing something, this just looks like a design error.

                        <br><br>
                        A more subtle issue we can see here is the sequencing of the CVP and CCP signals. Notice that the CVP signal is always enabled before the CCP signal, which causes the current
                        limit to kick in on every startup regardless of the programmed current.

                            <li>At this stage CCP is still set for 0A. It will still allow a small current to flow, due to some combination of calibration error and input offset voltage.
                                The current loop responds to the inrush current, but because it is still set for 0A, it instantly goes into current limit. The supply mode is now CC </li>
                            <li>The CCP level is usually programmed one cycle after the CVP level. This releases the current limit and the supply returns to CV mode, where we can see the CC-CV mode overshoot.</li>

                        The "multi-step" waveform is an easy fix, we just need the minimum CVP_SWITCH or CCP_SWITCH pulse duration to be much larger than the RC time constant, ~5x is usually considered enough. 
                        The programming pulse lengths are not consistent, but the shortest ones are around 2ms.
                        $$t_{switch} > 5R_{total}C$$
                        $$R_{total}C < t_{switch,min}/5 \rightarrow R_{total}C < 0.4\mathrm{ms} $$

                        With the default parameters \(R=1\mathrm{k}, C=940\mathrm{nF}\), and assuming a maximum switch resistance of 160ohm, $$R_{total}C = (1.160\mathrm{k})(940\mathrm{nF}) = 1.1\mathrm{ms}.$$
                        My recommendation is to replace the 1k with a smaller R=220, which gives $$R_{total}C = (380)(940\mathrm{nF}) = 0.36\mathrm{ms}.$$

                    <h6><b>CV/CC programming sequence fix</b></h6>
                    <p>
                        As for the sequencing issue, it's a relatively minor problem. More of an annoyance than anything. It's also quite a difficult one to fix, as it's entirely a firmware issue. 
                        The original ROM chip is a 27C512 UVEPROM, and I replaced it with a W27C512 EEPROM. <br><br>
                        You could dive into the 8051 assembly to reverse the order in the original firmware, or, you can find new firmware for a rebranded, later version of this unit:
                        <a href=https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/motech-amrel-pps-1002-diagramschematic/msg3605273/#msg3605273> link to EEVBLOG forums</a>. 

                        Though the boards in that Motech 1204 look completely different, and it uses a different ROM chip, it seems like the fundamental design is the same. This new firmware switches the CV and CC programming sequence. 
                        <br><br>
                        There are a few caveats, of course.
                        If the new firmware is loaded, the supply's calibration will be invalidated because the EEPROM addressing is not consistent between versions, and the internal calbration calculations are done differently. 
                        I also suspect the GPIB functionality may be broken with the new firmware, but I haven't checked this since I don't have any GPIB controllers. (I normally just use the RS-232, which this unit lacks).

                    <h5>Possible fixes: loop compensation</h5>
                    <h6><b>Voltage loop</b></h6>
                    <p>
                        <img src="2322/simulated overshoots.png" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        Now we get to the interesting part, dealing with the overshoot. Taking the reverse engineered circuit into LTspice, it seems that the overshoot at the CC/CV transition and the falling edge are both expected.
                        It is entirely possible something has gone faulty in both the real unit and in my simulation, but I figure the odds of that are low.<br><br>

                        <img src="2322/measured overshoot negative.png" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        Looking at the negative overshoot, for example, the simulated overshoot is remarkably close to what we can measure on the unit. <br><br>

                        <img src="2322/CV controller.png" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        The easiest modification which all but eliminates the overshoots in either direction is reducing the value of C48 from 6n8 to the ~100pF range. This fundamentally changes the controller behaviour,
                        and essentially removes the derivative action. <br><br>

                        <img src="2322/enable_overshoot_20V_fix_simulated.png" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        With C48 = 100pF, there is zero negative overshoot. There remains a very minor overshoot at the CC/CV transition, but it is below 50mV and very hard to notice. 
                        The CC-CV transition is kind of an "extreme" situation, so this is probably acceptable. More acceptable than several hundred mV, at least.
                        <br><br>

                        <img src="2322/all CV frd 100p.png" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        Using C48 = 100pF pushes the crossover frequency of the controller up to 350kHz and costs some phase margin, which drops by around 10 degrees compared to the stock configuration with the same loading condition. 
                        The phase margin is around 64 degrees in this case.<br><br>
                        Using C48 = 200pF results in a larger overshoot (100mV CC-CV overshoot and -20mV negative overshoot), but it yields a very good >80 degrees phase margin due to better compensation of the plant characteristics.
                        <br><br>
                        Anything between 100pF - 1nF for C48 results in markedly better performance than stock without getting close to instability. In real tests, it also happens to reduce the output voltage noise quite substantially, probably due to the higher bandwidth.
                        Of course, completely redoing the loop shaping is also an option here, but I think replacing C48 alone is good enough to solve most issues with a minimum modification.
                       
                    </p>
                    <h6><b>Current loop</b></h6>
                    <p>
                        <img src="2322/simulated current overshoot.png" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        Like with the real test, here we set up the LTspice model to deliver ~8V/10mA into a 47R load.
                        The simulation seems to show the slow CC regulation is expected. For the current loop, I like to at least have a 20mA-capable current limit, this is good enough to protect most things. <br><br>
                        <img src="2322/CC controller.png" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        In the current controller, changing C40 from 15nF to 1nF is enough to suppress the overshoot to below 20mA in any situation. <br><br>
                        <img src="2322/current overshoot 1nF.png" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>
                        Again, the load is a 47R resistor, and the current limit is set to 10mA. 
                        Even increasing the set voltage to the theoretical maximum 35V results in just under 13mA peak current, so this is fairly acceptable current limiting performance.
                        <br><br>

                        <img src="2322/all CC frd 1n.png" class="img-fluid maxImageWidth"></img><br>    
                        Looking at the frequency response, the phase margin of the CC system is around 74 degrees with C40 = 1nF. This is fine.
